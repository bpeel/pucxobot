Pucxobot is a Telegram robot and website to play the following games:

* Coup
* Love Letter
* 6 Takes!
* Fox in the Forest
* Vortofesto
* Chameleon
* Zombie Dice
* Snitch
* Superfight

If you just want to test it out on Telegram you can join
[this group](https://t.me/bluffing). Otherwise you can add
[@bluffingbot](https://t.me/bluffingbot) to your own group and play.

To try the website, go [here](https://gemelo.org/ludoj/en).

## Building

To build the server, you first need to install libcurl, json-c,
openssl and meson. On Fedora you can install them with the following
command:

    sudo dnf install json-c-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel meson ninja-build

On Debian you can install them with the following command:

    sudo apt install libjson-c-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev \
             pkg-config meson ninja-build

Next, to build the project type the following:

    meson build
    ninja -C build

Before running it, you need to create a configuration file in
`~/.pucxobot/conf.txt`. You can either run the server as the Telegram
bot, the website or both at the same time.

## Telegram Bot

To run the program as a Telegram bot you need to get an API key by
talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram. You can
enter it into the `conf.txt` with something like this:

    [bot]
    apikey = 123456789:AAABBEUAEUIEAIUE_auieauieauie
    botname = cardgamebot
    language = en

The language can be `en`, `fr`, `pt-br`, `zh-tw` or `eo`. You can
create several bots with one configuration file by repeating the
`[bot]` section. This is useful if you want to have multiple bots in
different languages.

To play a game, you can add the bot to a group and type `/join`. It
will present you with a choice of the available games to play.

You can also type `/help` to get a summary of the rules of the game.

## Website

To run the program as a website add something like this to the `conf.txt`:

    [server]
    address = 3648

You can change the port number or the listen address or leave the
`address` line out entirely to use the default port.

The server is just to run the WebSocket back-end and you will still
need an actual web server to serve the HTML and JavaScript files. The
files for the site are in the `web` directory. They are first filtered
through a script to generate the different translations. If you run
`ninja install` you can find all the web files ready in
`<prefix>/share/web`. The server can handle multiple languages
simultaneously so thereâ€™s no need to configure the language.

## HTTPS

If the webserver that serves the web pages is using HTTPS then
Pucxobot also needs to use TLS to handle the WebSockets or the browser
will refuse to connect to a mix of secure and insecure resources and
the site will not work. You can tell Pucxobot to use TLS by specifying
files for the certificate and private keys with the `certificate` and
`private_key` options in the `[server]` section. The default port for
the server with TLS is different from the one without. Therefore you
can make Pucxobot accept both secure and insecure connections with a
configuration like this:

    [server]

    [server]

    certificate = /path/to/cert.pem
    private_key = /path/to/key.pem

The first server section specifies the default unencrypted server on
port 3648 and the second one makes it additionally listen for
encrypted websockets on port 3649.

## Daemonize

If you pass `-d` to the program it will detach from the terminal and
run as a daemon. By default, Pucxobot prints log messages to the
terminal. However if it is run as a daemon it will instead log to
`~/.pucxobot/log.txt`. You can override this data file directory and
the log file by adding an extra section to the config like this:

    [general]
    data_dir = /var/run/puxcobot-data
    log_file = /var/log/my-super-log-file

The program needs write access to the data directory in order to store
its state.
